## 2. Lore and Story

- **Game World (Worldbuilding):**
    - **World Name:** Stasis
    - **Corporation Name:** Aegis
    - **World History:**
        - **The Era of Labor:** The world has always been a harsh place where survival depended on hard work. People were forced to work from dawn to dusk to provide for themselves and their families. Happiness and entertainment were considered unproductive and frowned upon by society.
        - **The Rise of "Aegis":** The "Aegis" Corporation gradually gained influence, offering "effective solutions" for improving productivity and resource management. Over time, it established control over all aspects of society, from the production and distribution of goods to education and culture.
        - **The Emergence of Magic:** In this harsh period, when hope seemed lost, the first wielder of the staff appeared. Thanks to his unwavering belief in the possibility of a miracle and the desire for a better life, he awakened the magic hidden within the staff. This became a spark of hope for those who were tired of endless labor and control.
        - **Modernity:** "Aegis" sees magic as a threat to its control and seeks to suppress it by any means. Society is divided: some believe in magic as salvation, others fear it as something unknown and dangerous.
    - **Game World (Possible Locations):**
        - **Central City (Citadel, Capital):** Remains a symbol of "Aegis" power. The city's architecture becomes even more functional and soulless, reflecting the priority of efficiency over aesthetics.
        - **Abandoned Working Districts:** Instead of magical ruins, there are abandoned factories, mines, and other industrial facilities, reminiscent of the world's difficult past. Here you can find not only artifacts, but also evidence of exploitation and oppression.
        - **Underground Communities:** Communities now consist not only of those who remember magic, but also of those who are simply tired of "Aegis" control and strive for freedom.
        - **"Aegis" Production Complexes:** These complexes become key locations where the player will encounter control and suppression technologies, as well as learn about the corporation's plans.
- **Backstory:**
In a world where the "Aegis" Corporation rules with an iron fist and labor is the only meaning of life, a spark of hope is born. In a secluded workshop, hidden from the corporation's all-seeing eye, a lone craftsman creates something unusual – a staff filled with his deep belief in the possibility of a miracle.
Driven by inexhaustible optimism and a desire to change the cruel reality, this man begins experimenting with the staff. His faith becomes a catalyst, awakening the dormant magic within the artifact. He becomes the first to know the power of the staff, discovering a world hidden from the eyes of ordinary mortals.
Inspired by his discovery, the first wielder of the staff decides to come out of the shadows and challenge "Aegis" itself. He strives to show the world that magic is not a threat, but a path to a better life. However, his attempt to convey the truth to the head of the corporation ends tragically: the boss of "Aegis," seeing magic as a danger to his power, mercilessly deals with the first mage.
The staff, seemingly lost forever, is thrown away as a useless trinket. But magic does not disappear without a trace – the staff has its own will and the ability to choose a new bearer.
Chance becomes the key to continuing the story. A passing street entity – whether a cockroach, an ant, a homeless person, a cat, or even an employee of "Aegis" itself – finds itself near the discarded staff. The artifact senses a spark, potential in it, and chooses it as its new owner.
This very moment becomes the starting point for each new game. Each time, the staff finds a new, random bearer, and the story begins anew – with new abilities, a new playstyle, but with one unchanging goal: to resist "Aegis" and return lost hope to the world.

## 3. Gameplay

- **Core Mechanics:**
    - **Staff Bearer Change (Transformation/Possession):**
        - **Random Selection:** At the beginning of each new game, the staff randomly chooses a new bearer from a pool of available characters (from insects to humans).
        - **Ability Transfer by the Staff:** After choosing a bearer, the staff "transfers" certain magical abilities to them, which may vary depending on the type of bearer.
    - **Magic System:**
        - **Spell Combinations:** The basis of the magic system is combining various spells and buffs.
        - **Magic Elements/Schools:** You can use various elements or schools of magic (fire, water, earth, air, technology, mental magic, etc.), which can be combined to create new effects.
        - **Influence on Stats:** Magic and buff combinations directly affect character stats (strength, agility, defense, speed, magic power, etc.).
        - **Combination Examples:**
            - Fire + Speed = Fire Dash (fast movement leaving a fiery trail).

    - **Combat System:**
        - **Dynamic Battles:** The combat system should be dynamic and fast-paced, requiring quick reactions and tactical thinking from the player.
